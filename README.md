In this notebook I generate a word cloud from descriptions and requirements of various data related job postings. The idea is the word cloud will clue me in on commonly occuring skills and attributes required for data related positions, allowing me to hone in my job search.

### Packages

You'll need the following packages

- numpy
- pandas
- wordcloud
- matplotlib

If you use anaconda, the worldcloud package can be obtained by using the following command:

conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud
